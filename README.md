# INFM600Project - Online News Popularity
Team Project for INFM600<br>
<h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4>
_______
Our aim with this project is to look at data about the popularity of news articles published on [Mashable](http://mashable.com/) over a period of 2 years. We try to identify the factors which significantly affect the number of shares an articles receives using basic statistical analysis. The data is publicly available and can be accessed [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online%20News%20Popularity). Our analysis can be broadly divided into three research questions.

<h4><b>Research Questions</b></h4>

_____
1. What is the best day to release an article? Does the best day vary with the type of news?
2. How does the number of images in an article affect the number of shares?
3. Does the rate of sharing positive and negative news vary with the time of the year?
